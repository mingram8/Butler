# Butler

<h2>What is it?</h2>
<p>A Node app that voice controls the home via HTML5 and <a href="http://github.com/mingram8/Node-House">Node-House</a>.</p>
<h2>How to use it?</h2>
<p>Clone the repository, and do an NPM install. You need espeak installed,  that is the voice, and a Chrome/Chromium browser, that does the voice recognition.</p>
<p>The command to 'ready the butler' is in the config/phrases.js file. Mine is, "Hey Bates", you can literally change it to anything. The voice recognition baked into the browsers isn't perfect, so do an array. The commands are in the /config/commands.js file. Same deal, should be an array. Use the current file as a guide. It has get requests, post requests, YQL requests, and a sports hack. You could add shell scripts or really anything, just set a condition for the type and have it execute the actions array. The extra flag allows the speech to be inserted after the url/http action</p>

<h2>Raspberry pi use</h2>

<p>I put my raspberry pi 2 in a radio/stereo box with a mic. It works wonderfully. I have it launch the node app and then launch Chromium to localhost:2001 on start up. Chromium automatically picks the mic. So it can be unplugged and moved anywhere and still start up fine. Make sure it autologs in and launches tot he cli. You can change that by typing sudo raspi-config.</p>

<p>I added <b>startx</b> to the end of ~/.bashrc and <b>sleep 20 ~/.startUp.sh</b> to my ~.xinitrc. Do it this way, because launching straight to the desktop doesn't fire .xinitrc. Not sure why. startUp.sh is as follows:</p>

<p>
#!/bin/bash </br>
cd ~/Butler</br>
node server.js & chromium-browser "https://localhost:2001"
</p>

<p>That should be it. Change /config/config.js to your <a href="http://github.com/mingram8/Node-House">Node-House</a> url and port, change your command files, and do pull requests with any cool aditions.
